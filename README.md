RADICaL
============

This is an implementation of the RADICaL model. RADICaL is an extension of LFADS for application to 2-photon (2p) calcium imaging data, as described in "A deep learning framework for inference of single-trial neural population activity from calcium imaging with sub-frame temporal resolution", Zhu F. et al. 2021, bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.21.469441v2). One of the techniques, Selective Backpropagation Through Time (SBTT), is described in "Deep inference of latent dynamics with spatio-temporal super-resolution using selective backpropagation through time", Zhu F\*, Sedler A\*, et al. NeurIPS 2021 (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/1325cdae3b6f0f91a1b629307bf2d498-Abstract.html).
